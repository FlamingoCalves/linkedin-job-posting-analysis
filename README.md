# LinkedIn Job Post Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of over 60,000 recent LinkedIn job postings to uncover what factors contribute to the success of a job listing, measured by the number of applications and views. Through comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression analysis, this study reveals intriguing insights into job market trends and applicant preferences.

## Key Findings
- **Remote Work Appeal**: Job postings offering remote work options significantly attract more views and applications.
- **Importance of Job Description Keywords**: A common set of words frequently used in job descriptions correlates with higher engagement, up to a certain threshold.
- **Experience Level and Job Type**: Postings aimed at associates or offering internships are particularly appealing, attracting distinct demographics.
- **Salary's Surprising Role**: Contrary to conventional wisdom, the salary offered in a job posting isn't the primary driver of its success.
- **Other Influential Factors**: The study also identifies the impact of pay periods, non-volunteer work preference, and the minimal effect of follower count on a job posting's performance.

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation**: Initial data cleaning to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Utilization of visual and statistical methods to explore relationships between variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Development of new features, such as average salary calculation and common word count.
- **Regression Analysis**: Application of linear regression to quantify the impact of various factors on job post success.
- **Normalization**: Scaling of features to ensure uniformity in variable impact assessment.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries to create insightful charts.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For regression analysis and feature scaling.

## Conclusions
This project sheds light on the nuanced dynamics of job posting success on LinkedIn. By dissecting various aspects of job listings, it provides employers with actionable insights to optimize their postings and job seekers with understanding into what makes a job attractive.

## Future Work
- Further stratification of the analysis by industry and job level to refine insights on salary impact.
- Integration of additional data sources to enrich the analysis and validate findings.
